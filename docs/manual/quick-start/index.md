# Quick Start

This guide will help you try Space Cloud quickly along with MongoDB without having to set up any project. This is the easiest way to explore the powers of Space Cloud.

If you instead want to start a project with Space Cloud from scratch then check out the [getting started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

> **Note**: Space Cloud works with any database. However, this guide assumes MongoDB as the data store for ease of use because of it's schemaless nature. 


## Choose a quick start guide:
- [Using Docker Compose](/docs/quick-start/docker-compose) **(recommended)**: Run a local development setup that sets up both the Space Cloud and MongoDB.
- [Using the binary](/docs/quick-start/manual): Manually deploy `space-cloud` on your machine.
- Using Heroku: Coming soon!
